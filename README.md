## Helping Mando
My mission was to help Mando with two specific tasks: 
1. Decode the list of available quests. 
2. Select the subset of quests that maximize Beskar's acquisition (maximize his financial return), given the amount of time Mando has available.

- For the first one, I used Deque to help me decode, you can read more about this data structure [hear](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//pythonds/BasicDS/WhatIsaDeque.html)
- To the second task, I used Dynamic Programming to solve it, because the time execution was to slow with recursion, so I needed to optimize my algorithm

If you know portuguese, this video is really good for understanding the second task [Problem of the backpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhDi025n5Uw&ab_channel=CarlaQuemDisse)

## ðŸ”Ž Understanding:
- To get more familiar with the problem, i wrote an context on [context.txt](./context.txt)

## ðŸš€ How to execute:
- Clone the repository using git clone
- On [tests.txt](./tests.txt) there are some examples of inputs and outputs of the problem.
- Run ```python project.py``` on your terminal

Observation: If you spot any bugs or duplication or something else on the code, please let me know.
