## Helping Mando
My mission was to help Mando with two specific tasks: 
1. Decode the list of available quests. 
2. Select the subset of quests that maximize Beskar's acquisition (maximize his financial return), given the amount of time Mando has available.
For the first one, I used Deque to help me decode, you can read more about this data structure [hear](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//pythonds/BasicDS/WhatIsaDeque.html)
To the second task, I used Dynamic Programming to solve it, because the time execution was to slow with recursion, so I needed to optimize my algorithm
If you know portuguese, this video is really good for understanding the second task [Problem of the backpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhDi025n5Uw&ab_channel=CarlaQuemDisse)
